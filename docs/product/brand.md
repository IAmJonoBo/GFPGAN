- Name: Restoria

## Scope statement

Restoria is a future‑proof, modular, and evaluation‑driven image restoration
toolkit for faces and general photos. It’s privacy‑first and local‑first by
default, with optional accelerators (torch.compile, ONNX Runtime) when
available. The architecture is multi‑backend and extensible — plug in
restorers, background upscalers, probes, and metrics without churn — and
results are measured with identity and perceptual metrics to keep improvements
grounded. Sensible defaults degrade gracefully if extras aren’t installed, and
the CLI is task‑first for single images and batches.
