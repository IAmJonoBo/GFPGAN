# GFPP Web (Next.js 15 + React 19)

This is a placeholder scaffold for the premium web UI. It targets:
- Upload/Queue/Results single-page flow
- Accessible before/after compare slider
- Streaming progress via SSE/WS
- Presets + per-image overrides

Commands (once app is fully scaffolded):

```
pnpm --filter apps/web dev
```

Until the full app is implemented, the components below are simple stubs to showcase structure.
